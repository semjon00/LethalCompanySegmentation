Files for creating and solving Lethal Company Segmentation competition. The competition is still live, feel free to participate in it! https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dl4cv-team10-lethal-company-segmentation

The Competition folder contains a plugin for the game, as well as frames post-processing (mask derivation) and balancer for the dataset. The Solution folder contains some attempts at solving the competition - some of them were not finished or work poorly, the best attempt is BraveSnake.

Please refer to wiki for some nice visualisations and explainers.

I would like to thank my amazing teammates Anette Habanen and Margus Lehtme, it was fun and rewarding working with you ðŸ™‚
